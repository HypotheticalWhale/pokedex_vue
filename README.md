# Accredify Frontend Assesment
p.s. i had a great time w this was very fun, i think its the most fun i've ever had on one of these asssesments bc pokemon 

A. what your project is about<br>
It's a pokedex, clicking on a pokemon card will give you more information about the pokemon <br>
to be honest i wanted to be a little bit more original but seeing as PokeAPI is one of the two recommended, i had no choice haha

B. the technologies used<br>
Vite,Vue,Js,HTML,CSS,PokeAPI,PokeAPI Sprites

C. instructions on how to run your project locally<br>
`yarn` <br>
`yarn dev`

D. your design considerations<br>
This is all new to me so i just tried my best to make the page look like pokemon (w the colors and fonts)<br>
A lot of this is new to me, before this i've never used Vue and Jest but it wasn't hard to pick up (i've used Node before w react)
